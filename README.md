# Data Processing and Transfer Script

This script processes a text report and transfers the cleaned and categorized data into specific cells in an Excel file. The operations include filtering lines based on patterns, removing certain date formats, extracting numerical data, categorizing content, and writing the results to individual output files. Finally, it writes the processed data to an Excel sheet in specific locations.

- **Packages**:
  - `re` (Regular Expressions for pattern matching)
  - `openpyxl` (for handling Excel files)
